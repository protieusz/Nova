Soldering the optional RGBs for Nova.

Pay attention to the "notches" icon silkscreen & the "dots" icon silksreen.

Notches are the GROUND notch legs of the LEDS.

Dots are the 5v legs.

Do not mess them up or else your pcb will not work and you will have a headache removing the solder RGBs and resolder them. I will not provide any support for soldering skills. You have been warned.

The pictures are pretty self explainatory. If you don't have the confidence of soldering RGBs then don't do it. It is not the end of the world.

All RGBs are labelled. Start test out the lowest label number first. Solder the one and plug in and test it out. By default the RGB will light up RED if you solder it properly.

Good luck!
